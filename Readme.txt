I started with writing the makefile and then implementing the functions one by one and testing them simoultaneously.

I faced problems with pointers as I am not adept at them and got errors like segmentation fault etc. In the beginning, as I had very little understanding of pointers, I took reference from stack overflow and Techie website, but after one or two functions, I implemented the remaining on my own. 

I have implemented ALL the given functions, namely

strcopy, 
my_strcpy(the length limited string copy function), 
str concat, 
my_strcat( the length limited string concatenation function), 
string compare, 
string compare with length limitation,
strchr (finding first occurence of a character),
strchrnul(finding first occurence of character in a string or returning the end of the string),
strnchr(finding first occurence of a character in a length limited string),
strrchr(finding the last occurence of a character in a string),
skip_spaces (remove leading spaces from a string),
strim(remove leading and trailing spaces from a string),
strlen(calculate the length of a string),
strnlen(calculate the length of a length-limited string),
memset (Fill a region of memory with the given value).
